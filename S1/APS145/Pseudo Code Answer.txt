Workshop 1
-----------------------------------------
1. declare pre-game variables:	studentRoll1
								studentRoll2
								startPlayer

2. declare game-play variables:	player1Points = 0
								player2Points = 0
								tiedGames = 0
								shotCount
								activePlayer

3. declare end-game variables:	winnerPoints
								loserPoints
								amountOwing

4. Student 1 activates animated die roll
5. SET: studentRoll1 to the die roll result
6. Student 2 activates animated die roll
7. SET: studentRoll2 to the die roll result

8. Die rolling result?
	Tie: (studentRoll1 = studentRoll2)
		a) Repeat from step #4
	
	Student1 wins: student1 roll is bigger than student2 roll (studentRoll1 > studentRoll2)
		a) SET: startPlayer = student1

	Student2 wins: student2 roll is bigger than student1 roll (studentRoll2 > studentRoll1)
		a) SET: startPlayer = student2
			
9. Display winner of the die roll and inform which student will shoot first (activePlayer)
	"[startPlayer] won the die roll and will shoot first"
	
10. SET: activePlayer = startPlayer

11. SET: shotCount = 0
12. activePlayer takes a shot
13. ADD: 1 to shotCount
14. Did the shot go into the basket?
	YES:a) Is activePlayer = student1?
			YES: ADD: 1 to player1Points
			NO : ADD: 1 to player2Points
			
		b) DISPLAY: "Basket went in! Points awarded!"
		
15. Reach maximum allowed shots? (shotCount = 4)
	YES: Has each player completed their shots? (activePlayer != startPlayer)
	
		NO : Switch the players...
			a) startPlayer = student1?
				YES: SET: activePlayer = student2
				NO : SET: activePlayer = student1
				
			b) Display next player's turn: "Take your shots!"
			c) Repeat from step#11
			
	NO : Repeat from step#12
	
16. What are the game results?
		Tied Game: (player1Points = player2Points)
			a) ADD: 1 to tiedGames
			b) Repeat from step#10
		 
		Player1 Wins: (player1Points > player2Points)
			a) DISPLAY: "Player 1 wins"
			b)	SET: winnerPoints = player1Points
			c)	loserPoints = player2Points
			
		Player2 Wins: (player2Points > player1Points) 
			a) DISPLAY: "Player 2 wins"
			b) SET: winnerPoints = player2Points
			c) loserPoints = player1Points

17. SET: amountOwing = winnerPoints - loserPoints
18. Were there any tied games? (tiedGames > 0)
	YES: Reduce impact of tied games...
		 a) SET: amountOwing = amountOwing - (tiedGames * 0.5)
		 b) Is amountOwing zero or negative? (amount owing <= 0)
			YES: SET: amountOwing = 1
			
		 c) Is amountOwing a fractional number?
			YES: Round UP to next whole number (amountOwing + 1)
			
19. DISPLAY: "Winner receives [amountOwing] from the loser!"
20. End
