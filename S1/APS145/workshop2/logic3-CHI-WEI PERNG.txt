Workshop 2 [Logic 3]
-----------------------------------------
1.  Declare weather conditions and action variables:	
        weather: Snow || Ice || Mixed
        accumulation: In millimeters.
        temperature: In Celsius degrees
        outputActions: Display sting.

2.  City service clerks enter input data.

3.  Set weather conditions input
        weather = Ice;
        accumulation = accumulation;
        temperature = temperature;

4.  If(accumulation <= 3.0){
        outputActions = "No Action Required";
    }elseif(3.0 < accumulation && accumulation <= 5.5){
        If(temperature < -15.0){
            outputActions = "1 (Normal) of Sand Trucks";
        }elseif(-15.0 < temperature && temperature < -7.0){
            outputActions = "1 (Normal) of Salt Trucks";
        }else{
            outputActions = "No Action Required";
        }
    }elseif(5.5 < accumulation && accumulation <= 17.0){
        If(temperature < -15.0){
            outputActions = "2 (Heavy) of Sand Trucks";
        }elseif(-15.0 < temperature && temperature < -7.0){
            outputActions = "2 (Heavy) of Salt Trucks";
        }else{
            outputActions = "1 (Heavy) of Salt Trucks";
        }
    }else(17.0 < accumulation){
        outputActions = "State of emergency (Organize army and other jurisdiction support)";
    }

5. Display: outputActions on web application.
