     startTime = 0 
     currentTime = 0 
     secondsDiff = 0 
     countTime = 3 (seconds) 

4. Display “Start playing” 

5. Capture current time:

            secondsDiff = currentTime - startTime 
        c) Did the player pick rock, paper or scissor? 
            YES: Store user-entered choice to variable playerChoice
