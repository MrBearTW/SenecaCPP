1. Declare variables: 
    startTime = 0
    currentTime = 0
    secondsDiff = 0
    timeCountdown = 3 (seconds)
    randomNumber = (1, 2, 3)
    computerPlay
    humanPlay
    winner = (Tie, Human, Computer)

2. Declare correspondence table between randomNumber and objects
    1 = Rock
    2 = Paper
    3 = Scissors
            
3. Srart a game
    DISPLAY: New game starts.
    
4. Call random function to yield a number 1~3
    SET: randomNumber = Random function yield number

5. Use correspondence table to get computerPlay objects
    SET: computerPlay = correspondenceTable(randomNumber)

6. DISPLAY: Pleace choice Rock / Paper / Scissors

7. Capture current time: 
	startTime = (now)
	currentTime = startTime

8. Did human player choose their desired object?
    NO: Is secondsDiff equal to timeCountdown?
        YES: Repeat from step #3
        NO:	a) update currentTime = (now)
            b) How many seconds have past?
                secondsDiff = currentTime - startTime
            c) Repeat from step #8
    YES: a) SET: humanPlay = human player chooses
         b) Are humanPlay and computerPlay objects are same?
             YES: humanPlay and computerPlay objects are same.
                1)
                    humanPlay = Rock and computerPlay = Rock: SET: winner = Tie
                    humanPlay = Scissors and computerPlay = Scissors: SET: winner = Tie
                    humanPlay = Paper and computerPlay = Paper: SET: winner = Tie 
                2) DISPLAY: "Tie, Please try again."
                3) Repeat from step #3
             NO: humanPlay and computerPlay objects are different.
                1)
                    humanPlay = Rock and computerPlay = Scissors: SET: winner = Human.
                    humanPlay = Scissors and computerPlay = Paper: SET: winner = Human.
                    humanPlay = Paper and computerPlay = Rock: SET: winner = Human.
                    humanPlay = Scissors and computerPlay = Rock: SET: winner = Computer.
                    humanPlay = Paper and computerPlay = Scissors: SET: winner = Computer.
                    humanPlay = Rock and computerPlay = Paper: SET: winner = Computer.
                2) DISPLAY: "Winner is [winner]."
