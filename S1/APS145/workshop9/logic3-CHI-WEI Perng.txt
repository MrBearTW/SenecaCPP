2. Declare variables:
    letterGuessesTime = 8
    guessWordAnswer = []
    guessWordAnswerLetterCount = 0
    playerInputWord = []
    guessWordResult = 0
    playerInputLetter = []
    guessLetterResult = -1
    revealedLetters = []
    useTime = 0

3. Display:

4. Produced this time guess word.
    A. Call Blackbox function: GenerateWord
    B. guessWordAnswer = GenerateWord()

    D. Set revealedLetters = "_" * guessWordAnswerLetterCount

5. Display: 
    A. Display: This time guess word length is X letter. (X = guessWordAnswerLetterCount)
    B. Display: revealedLetters
    C. Display: You have Y time can guess letter. (Y = letterGuessesTime)

6. Check letterGuessesTime?
    Case: letterGuessesTime > 0
        Display: Do you want to guess a word?

                D. guessWordResult = GuessWord(playerInputWord)
                E. guessWordResult = ?
                    Case 0: Did not match
                        1) useTime = useTime + 20
                        2) Go to step #8
                    Case 1: Matched
                        1) useTime = useTime + 2
                        2) Go to step #9
            No: Goto Step #7
    Case: letterGuessesTime = 0

            E. guessWordResult = GuessWord(playerInputWord)
            F. guessWordResult = ?
                Case 0: Did not match
                    1) useTime = useTime + 25
                    2) Go to steap #8
                Case 1: Matched
                    1) useTime = useTime + 5
                    2) Go to steap #9

    E. guessLetterResult = GuessLetter(playerInputLetter)
    F. guessLetterResult result ?
        Case 1: Guesses a letter correctly
            1) letterGuessesTime = letterGuessesTime + 1
            2) useTime = useTime + 3
