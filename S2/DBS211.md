- Junction / Bridge Table (Convert "many to many" --> "one to many")
  - 把兩個多對多的關係，新增一個 Table，變成兩個一對多的關係在新的 Table

## Database Rules

1. Every table must have one and only one primary key (unique identifier)
2. No Repeating Data (same data same table)
3. No Redundant Data (same data different table)
4. Do not include calculated fields!
5. All fields must be atomic (only one value per cell)

## 5 types of keys

1. PRIMARY KEY
2. COMPOSITE KEY - which is a primary key made up of more than one
3. FOREIGN KEY - child side of the relationship
4. 
5. 

## Relationship Types

- One to Many (Many to One) - 99.9% of relationships
- Many to One - CANNOT physically exit
- One to One - rare but useful for efficiency, non redundancy
