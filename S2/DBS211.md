# DBS211   Introduction to Database Systems

- [dbs211.ca](http://dbs211.ca/courses/dbs211/)

- A place to store data, that can extract information.

- 98% involve to database.

## Week1

- Database management system
  - see drawio

- Age --> Date af birth

- Date
  - -200 BC == 2255 ago
    - BC
    - DC
  - Century
    - 1901~2000
    - 2001~2100
  - Leap year
    - 365.249
    - Not 365 366

## Week2

- Table name --> All CAPITAL
- Naming
  - [type] is a key word in software
  - Date + Time --> DateTime
  - ID --> xxxID
- Junction / Bridge Table (Convert "many to many" --> "one to many")
  - 把兩個多對多的關係，新增一個 Table，變成兩個一對多的關係在新的 Table

- Database must work yesterday, today and tomorrow
- One team at a time

## 5 rules of Database

1. Every table must have one and only one primary key (unique identifier)
2. No Repeating Data (Same data same table)
3. No Redundant Data (Same data different table)
4. Do not include calculated fields!(Math, String, dates, concatenation)
5. All fields must be atomic (only one value per cell)

## 5 types of keys

1. PRIMARY KEY
2. FOREIGN KEY - child side of the relationship
3. COMPOSITE KEY - which is a primary key made up of more than one
4. Surrogate key (Replacement to a primary key, but is a Primary key) (Do this after this semester)
5. Candidate Key (Potential Primary key, Never exists in finalized database designs)

## 3 types Relationship

- One to Many (Many to One) - 99.9% of relationships
- Many to Many - CANNOT physically exit / exists in theory, not physically
- One to One - rare but useful for efficiency, non redundancy

## 3 types of Tables

- Data table
- Junction/Bridge table -> simulate to many to many relationships.
- Lookup table

## Referential Integrity

- To ensure the consistency and integrity of the data, avoiding orphan record
  - You can not delete a parent record while children exist.
  - You can not have children unless the parent already exist.
    - Foreign keys may be NULL

## NULLS

- A representation of no knowledge, you do not know the answer or even if an answer exists!
