# OOP244   Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

- C++

## Week1

- namespace

## Week2

- forward declaration
  - include 順序會造成不一樣的效果
- default 要在最後一個（右邊）

- header guard / Compilation Safeguards
  - just use `#pragma once`

## Nail Your C++ Interview

- C++ is derived from C
- Difference
  - | **C**                      | **C++**                     |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | Procedural                 | Object-oriented/procedural  |
    | Manual if/else logic       | Built-in exception handling |
    | Scoping via static members | Encapsulation via classes   |
- Object Orientation
  - What makes object oriented programming special is its use of objects(classes).
    - A place to store data that can be used again and again, is the number one way object oriented programming change development.
    - Classes make code easier to manage and reuse
  - Polymorphism.
    - Then we can instantiate a version with all the defined attributes, another with some of the attributes and even a third with added attributes as we need.
    - If we create a generic bank class, we can instantiate it two times in multiple forms for two different banks.
  - Creating a version of the original with added items is the second feature of object oriented programming called inheritance.
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

- Structs: Class without methods
