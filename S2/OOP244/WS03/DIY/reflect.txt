Reflection:

- to define a class type 
Define in both ".h" file create class "CalorieList" and "Food". 
Set all data and some functions private, some function public. 
  
- to privatize data within the class type 
Class members default is private. So, I need to use public functions to query or change class data. 

- to instantiate an object of class type 
I instantiate a Food in function "void CalorieList::init(int size)". 
It will use constructor "Food" for Food.h to create instance. 

- to use member functions to query the state of an object 
In function "int Food::getCalories() const".  
Can be used to get private data in food. 

- to use member functions to change the state of an object 
In function "bool CalorieList::add(const char *item_name, int calories, int when)" 
Can update food data from input parameter. 

- to use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream 
In function "void Food::display() const" and "void CalorieList::display() const" use "setf", "width", "fill", "unsetf" these format function to modify output fit workshop requirement. 

- to describe to your instructor what you have learned in completing this workshop 
In this workshop I can instantiate an object using class. It can include variables and functions, in addition, I can specify their scope using public keywords if needed. 
Use const on functions to prevent changing the value of data. 
Stat design variables and functions into public and private two categories.
