1. In the lab 

- Confuses  why we are using a virtual function 
    virtual void write(std::ostream &os) const; 

 	- Explain: 
        // Text* t = new HtmlText; 
        // t.write(); 

        // with virtual we will call based on dynamic type aka html 
        // wihtout virtual we will always call static type aka text 

        // Key word: dynamic dispatch
        // Check class demon: Animal / Hours 


2. Learning Outcomes 

- Apply the rule of three and its derived class. 
    - Apply the rule of three to both the Text and HtmlText classes.
    - rule of three
        - destructor
        - copy constructor
        - copy assignment operator

- Use your acquired skills throughout the semester to read a file into dynamically allocated memory. 
    - Read a file into dynamically allocated memory.
    - In the tester function, read the file into a Text object.
    - In the Test class, read the file into a Text object.
  

3. Problem I meet in this workshop 
- I miss using different kind of parameter in virtual function and implement function af first time.
    - So, I use some time to debug, and find out the problem and fix it.
- I learn why need to use virtual to do dynamic dispatch. 
    - Because we want to call the function based on dynamic type. 
    - If we don't use virtual, we will always call the function based on static type. 
    - So, we will always call the function in base class. 
    - But, if we use virtual, we will call the function based on dynamic type. 
    - So, we will call the function in derived class. 
    - So, we can use virtual to do dynamic dispatch.
