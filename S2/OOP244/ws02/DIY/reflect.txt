As required in the workshop, use 
- Unction overloading: 
    - read: Read char* postcode. / Read int population.
    - load: Loads data from a file. / Load one row.
    - display: Display all with no parameters. / Display one row.
- Reference: read / load / display 
- Dynamic memory allocation: 
    - function load() -> when create new struct to load all data. 
    - function load() -> create new char array for postcode.
		- Although the postcode in the " PCpopulationsComplete.csv‚Äù seems to all be three characters, it should be seven characters in general, such as school address "M2J 2X5". 

In addition, I wrote a sorting method myself at the beginning, but when I compared the correct answer after uploading the matrix, I found that it was different from the correct answer. Later, after being reminded by my classmates, I realized that there would be no problem with the ws01 sorting method.
