      center, and its influence ranges from Japan to Singapore, all East Asia, and global Chinese
      culture. Taiwan’s music industry has also been continuously developing and has many talented
      musicians. In addition, Taiwan’s geographical location has made it a cultural exchange center
      in East Asia. In the Golden Melody Awards in recent years, you can see a variety of music

    <h3>Aboriginal music</h3>
    <p>
      The song you are referring to is called “Elders Drinking Song” or “老人飲酒歌” in Chinese. It
      is an Amis folk song that has been passed down for generations. The song was used without
      permission in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics theme song “Return to Innocence” by German band
      Enigma, which led to a three-year international music copyright lawsuit Ref:

    <!-- Garbage truck music -->
    <h3>Garbage truck music</h3>
    <p>
      Taiwan has a unique garbage truck culture where the trucks play music. The “garbage doesn’t
      touch the ground” policy requires residents to bring trash directly out of their homes to the
      trucks, resulting in more hygienic streets in Taiwan’s sweaty climate. The government has
      implemented what is commonly known in Taiwan as a “trash doesn’t touch the ground” system -
      and to newcomers, this can be mind-boggling. Residents gather on the streets with their bags
      of rubbish and have to throw them into the trucks themselves.
